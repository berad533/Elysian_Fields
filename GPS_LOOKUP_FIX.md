   - More detailed logging for debugging
   - Proper exception handling

3. **Better Desktop App Feedback**
   - Clear error messages when backend isn't running
   - Timeout handling for geocoding requests
   - Specific error messages for different failure types

## 🚀 **How to Use GPS Lookup (Fixed):**

### **Step 1: Start the Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### **Step 2: Start the Desktop App**

## ✅ **Test Results:**

The GPS lookup is now working perfectly:

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you get "Backend not connected" error:**
1. Make sure the backend is running: `cd backend && python app.py`
2. Check that you see: `* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### **If you get "Request timed out" error:**
1. Try a more specific address (include city, state)
2. Use manual coordinates instead
3. Check your internet connection

### **If you get "No results found" error:**
1. Try a more specific address
2. Include city and state in the address

## 🎯 **One-Command Solution:**

Use the complete startup script:

python start_all.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Start the backend server
- ✅ Launch the desktop application
- ✅ Handle everything automatically

## 📝 **Example Addresses That Work:**

- "Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA"
